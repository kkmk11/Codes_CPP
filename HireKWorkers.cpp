// You are given a 0-indexed integer array costs where costs[i] is the cost of hiring the ith worker.

// You are also given two integers k and candidates. We want to hire exactly k workers according to the following rules:

// You will run k sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
// In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
// For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4th worker because they have the lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].
// In the second hiring session, we will choose 1st worker because they have the same lowest cost as 4th worker but they have the smallest index [3,2,7,7,2]. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.
// If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.
// A worker can only be chosen once.
// Return the total cost to hire exactly k workers.

//  input format:
//  size
//  array
//  k
//  no of candidates

// Example 1:

// Input: costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8], k = 3, candidates = 4
// Output: 11
// Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
// - In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 3. The total cost = 0 + 2 = 2.
// - In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 4). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
// - In the third hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.
// The total hiring cost is 11.
// Example 2:

// Input: costs = [1,2,4,1], k = 3, candidates = 3
// Output: 4
// Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
// - In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [1,2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 0. The total cost = 0 + 1 = 1. Notice that workers with index 1 and 2 are common in the first and last 3 workers.
// - In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1 (index 2). The total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.
// - In the third hiring round there are less than three candidates. We choose the worker from the remaining workers [2,4]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 0). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
// The total hiring cost is 4.
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= costs.length <= 105 
// 1 <= costs[i] <= 105
// 1 <= k, candidates <= costs.length
